#twitcheck
twitcheck is a quick and simple command-line tool to let you checkin on a Twitter user. And tell you what word they have been using most frequently.

##Installing
We suggest using the lovely go get tool to quickly add it to your path.
```
go get -u github.com/mvryan/twitcheck
```
Additionally twitcheck searches the current directory for a configuration file.

config.json
```json
{
	"ConsumerKey":"YOUR-KEY-HERE",
	"ConsumerSecret":"YOUR-SECRET-HERE"
}

```

##Usage
Simply supply twitcheck with a user name and it will pull recent information about them and provide information about the calls to the API.
```
